> [!WARNING]
> g0efilter is in active development and its configuration may change often.

g0efilter is a lightweight container designed to filter outbound (egress) traffic from attached container workloads. Run g0efilter alongside your workloads and attach them to share its network namespace to enforce a simple IP and domain allowlist policy.

### Background

As a self-hoster running many open source apps, I wanted an easy way to restrict outbound connections from containers, since not all can be trusted. While Docker supports internal-only networks, some containers still need selective network and internet access. The goal was to support wildcard subdomains (for example, *.example.com) without terminating TLS connections or relying solely on IP allowlisting, as CDNs often use multiple, changing IPs across many subdomains. This can be done with third-party firewall products, but the aim here is an open source, lightweight filter that runs alongside Docker Compose workloads...so here we are.

### Features

- **Egress filtering** - Explicitly allow specified IPs/CIDRs and domains in a policy file; anything not on the allowlist is blocked
- **Wildcard subdomain support** - Allow wildcard subdomains like `*.example.com` to match any subdomain level
- **Two filtering modes** - HTTPS (TLS SNI/HTTP Host inspection) or DNS-based filtering
- **Live policy reloading** - Update policy.yaml without restarting containers
- **Real-time dashboard** - Web UI with SSE streaming for traffic monitoring
- **Remote unblock** - Unblock domains/IPs from the dashboard UI (with auth middleware)
- **Notifications** - Gotify alerts for blocked traffic events

### Quick Start

Refer to the [examples](https://github.com/g0lab/g0efilter/tree/main/examples).

### How it works

Attach containers to g0efilter by setting `network_mode: "service:g0efilter"` in Docker Compose, which shares g0efilter's network namespace (network stack) with those containers. Traffic from attached containers is filtered based on a policy file that defines allowlisted IPs/CIDRs and domains.

**Traffic to allowlisted IPs/CIDRs** bypasses all filtering and passes through directly.

**Traffic to other IPs** is subject to domain-level filtering based on the `FILTER_MODE` environment variable (`https` or `dns`):

- **HTTPS mode (default):** Outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic on ports 80/443 is intercepted and redirected to local services running inside g0efilter. These services inspect plain text packet data, including the HTTP `Host` header (for HTTP) or TLS SNI from the TLS Client Hello (for HTTPS, without terminating the connection), and cross-reference it against the allowlist. If the domain is allowed, the connection is established and traffic flows through (the service acts as a middleman). If not found in the allowlist, the connection is reset and traffic is blocked.

- **DNS mode:** DNS queries are intercepted and redirected to an internal DNS server. The server only resolves allowlisted domains and non-allowlisted queries receive NXDOMAIN responses. Note that direct IP connections bypass DNS filtering entirely.

**Filter Logic Flow (HTTPS mode):**
```
Start
│
├─► Is destination IP in allowlist? ── Yes ─► ALLOW (skip remaining steps, no redirect)
│                                   └─ No ─► continue
│ 
├─► Is connection already established? ── Yes ─► ALLOW (skip remaining steps, no redirect)
│                                      └─ No ─► continue
│ 
├─► Is destination port 80 or 443? ── No ─► BLOCK
│                                  └─ Yes ─► continue
│
├─► Redirect to local filter service (port 8080 for HTTP, 8443 for HTTPS)
│
├─► Extract domain from Host header (HTTP) or SNI (TLS)
│
├─► Does domain match allowlist? ── Yes ─► FORWARD to original destination
│                                └─ No ─► DROP
│
└─► LOG decision → Send to dashboard (if enabled) ─► End
```

> [!NOTE]
> Attached containers share g0efilter's network namespace and must not bind to ports used by g0efilter.  
> By default, g0efilter uses `HTTP_PORT` (8080), `HTTPS_PORT` (8443), and optionally `DNS_PORT` (53).

### Dashboard container

The optional **g0efilter-dashboard** container runs a web UI on **port 8081** (by default). If `DASHBOARD_HOST` and `DASHBOARD_API_KEY` are set, g0efilter will ship logs to the dashboard.

Example Dashboard Screenshot:

![g0efilter-dashboard-example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g0lab/g0efilter/main/examples/images/g0efilter-dashboard-example.png)

### Example policy.yaml

```yaml
allowlist:
  ips:
    - "1.1.1.1"
    - "192.168.0.0/16"
    - "10.1.1.1"
  domains:
    - "github.com"
    - "*.alpinelinux.org"
```

> [!NOTE]
> - The policy file supports live reloading: edits to policy.yaml automatically trigger rule and service updates without needing to restart the container. The internal g0efilter services are restarted, but the container itself remains running.
> - If you do not need live reloading, you can use environment variables (ALLOWLIST_IPS, ALLOWLIST_DOMAINS) instead of a policy file. If both are present, environment variables take precedence.

## Remote Unblock Feature

The **remote unblock** feature allows administrators to unblock domains or IPs directly from the dashboard UI. When enabled, g0efilter instances poll the dashboard for pending unblock requests and automatically update their policy files.

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is **disabled by default** (`ENABLE_REMOTE_UNBLOCK=false`). Do not enable this in non-test environments without proper authentication middleware protecting the dashboard. The `POST /api/v1/unblocks` endpoint must be protected by reverse proxy authentication (e.g., Authelia, Authentik, PocketID) to prevent unauthorized users from modifying your allowlist.

## Dashboard Reverse Proxy Suggestion

I would recommend to place the **g0efilter-dashboard** behind a reverse proxy such as Traefik with the following controls:

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `GET /health` | None | Health check for monitoring/load balancers |
| `POST /api/v1/logs` | API Key | Log ingestion from g0efilter containers |
| `GET /api/v1/unblocks?hostname=X` | API Key | Poll pending unblock requests (used by g0efilter) |
| `POST /api/v1/unblocks/ack` | API Key | Acknowledge processed unblock (used by g0efilter) |
| `GET /` | Middleware | Dashboard web UI |
| `GET /api/v1/logs` | Middleware | Read logs |
| `GET /api/v1/events` | Middleware | Server-Sent Events stream |
| `DELETE /api/v1/logs` | Middleware | Clear logs |
| `POST /api/v1/unblocks` | Middleware | Create unblock request (from dashboard UI) |
| `GET /api/v1/unblocks/status` | Middleware | Poll unblock status (from dashboard UI) |

### Example Traefik Configuration

If using Traefik as a reverse proxy, here's an example of a working yaml based configuration using two routers to handle different authentication requirements:

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    g0efilter-ingest-router:
      entryPoints:
        - websecure
      rule: "Host(`g0efilter.example.com`) && ((PathPrefix(`/api/v1/logs`) && Method(`POST`)) || PathPrefix(`/health`) || (Path(`/api/v1/unblocks`) && Method(`GET`) && QueryRegexp(`hostname`, `^.+$`)) || (Path(`/api/v1/unblocks/ack`) && Method(`POST`)))"
      service: g0efilter-dash-service
      middlewares:
        - security-headers
        - ratelimit
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
        domains:
          - main: "example.com"
            sans:
              - "*.example.com"

    g0efilter-dash-router:
      entryPoints:
        - websecure
      rule: "Host(`g0efilter.example.com`)"
      service: g0efilter-dash-service
      middlewares:
        - security-headers
        - ratelimit
        - auth-oidc  # Your auth middleware
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
        domains:
          - main: "example.com"
            sans:
              - "*.example.com"

  services:
    g0efilter-dash-service:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://g0efilter-dashboard:8081"
```

**How it works:**
- `g0efilter-ingest-router`: Matches `POST /api/v1/logs`, `/health`, `GET /api/v1/unblocks?hostname=X`, and `POST /api/v1/unblocks/ack` - no SSO required (API key auth)
- `g0efilter-dash-router`: Matches all other requests to the dashboard - requires SSO/OIDC authentication
- The more specific ingest router rule takes precedence for API calls and health checks
- All other traffic (UI, reads, etc.) goes through the dashboard router with SSO protection


### Example docker-compose.yaml

```yaml
services:
  g0efilter:
    image: docker.io/g0lab/g0efilter:latest
    container_name: g0efilter
    volumes:
      - ./policy.yaml:/app/policy.yaml
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN # Required for nftables modification
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges
    # Host-exposed port for dashboard (dashboard runs in same netns)
    ports:
      - 8081:8081 # Dashboard port
    read_only: true
    restart: always
    env_file:
      - .env

  g0efilter-dashboard:
    image: docker.io/g0lab/g0efilter-dashboard:latest
    container_name: g0efilter-dashboard
    # optional - custom user
    # user: 1000:1000
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges
    read_only: true
    env_file:
      - .env.dashboard
    network_mode: "service:g0efilter"
    restart: always

  example-container:
    image: docker.io/alpine/curl:latest
    command: sh -c "sleep infinity"
    network_mode: "service:g0efilter"
```

### Verifying the Container Signatures

The g0efilter container images are signed with [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) using keyless signing:

```bash
# Verify g0efilter container
cosign verify g0lab/g0efilter:latest \
  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/g0lab/g0efilter \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  -o text

# Verify g0efilter-dashboard container
cosign verify g0lab/g0efilter-dashboard:latest \
  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/g0lab/g0efilter \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  -o text
```
